# Working memory during a temporal summation of second pain


This task has 4 conditions: “attention to pain”, “0-back pain”, “2-back pain” and “2-back no pain”. The first three conditions are presented with repetitive painful stimuli (using the TCS stimulator, https://www.qst-lab.eu/tcs-technical-description), while the last condition was presented without nociceptive stimulation. The instructions appear on the screen at the beginning of each condition, indicating the condition (attention to pain, 0-back or 2-back) and the hand with which they should hold the stimulator. Participants have to evaluate the pain experienced when on a VAS scale shown after each block.  The times of presentation of the painful stimuli and the visual stimuli are randomly distributed and can coincide or not at the same time. In the conditions “0-back pain” and “2-back pain” the last stimulus of the cognitive task is presented at a random time between 2.0 and 2.8 before the onset of S12.
