# Temporal Summation of Second Pain during CT stimulation

This is a programmed to perform a TSSP protocol using an in-house built thermal stimulator and a second stimulator with a brush (CT touch) or a vibration plate (discriminative touch). The task comunicates with the stimulator via serial port and sends the triggers to begin the different types of touch and pain.
