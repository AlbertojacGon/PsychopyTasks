# Affective Touch videos

This task presents videos in which scenes of affective touch (one person touching another) are observed. 

There are 15 different videos with the possible combinations of speed (3 levels: static, slow touch or fast touch) and location (5 levels: palm of the hand, inner side of the arm, outer side of the arm, forearm, and back). Each video lasts 4 seconds and is presented 10 times (in 2 blocks with a break in the middle). After 2 of these 10 presentations a Visual-Analogue Scale (VAS, with values ranging from 1 to 7 in 0.1 steps) is presented in which the participant must evaluate how pleasant the touch was for the person being touched and how pleasant it would be for them to be touched in this way. 

The task sends the triggers for EEG recording by parallel port. Triggers from 201 to 243 signal the presentation of the video. Triggers from 10 to 70 signal the response to the first VAS, and from 110 to 170 the response to the second VAS.
